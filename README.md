This project gets a joke based on your chosen category and displays it on the site.

It uses JokeAPI (public API)to retrieve the joke - documentation can be found here:
https://v2.jokeapi.dev/

To use this, you need to have all dependencies as displayed in "package.json" file. If you download mine, you don't have to initialize the npm, but you certainly need to have it installed. In any case, you need to install the packages by going into terminal (cd from the root folder of the project) and type "npm i".

As part of Angela Yu's Web Development Bootcamp, this site is a Capstone Project intended to showcase the knowledge of using public APIs and showcasing the results on a website by building the site from scratch without mentoring feedback. I have chosen the joke API because I thought something funny should be done on this particular rainly day.
